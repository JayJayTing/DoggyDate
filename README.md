# Our-Frist-Project

Let us brainstorm an app project and tech stack together.

## DOGGY PLAY DATE

# What does it do?
- Users can sign up for an account on the app and see available dogs to play with near you 
- You can message dog owners near you and set up a time a play date

# Views (so far)
- Map view (dogs near you)
- Profile (picture of your dog, age, interests, special needs, favourite treat :D)
- Messages (I'm thinking something similar to fb messenger?)

# Tech Stack
- Front end ? I would like to do anything but React so I'm open to suggestions :D
- Back end ? Also open to suggestions and not opposed to Node.js. Keep in mind that for the BE we need to implement sockets for messenger feature.
- GraphQL?
